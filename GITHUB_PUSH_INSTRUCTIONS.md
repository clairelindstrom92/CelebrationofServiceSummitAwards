# GitHub Push Instructions

Your code is committed and ready to push to GitHub!

## Steps to Create and Push to GitHub

### 1. Create a New Repository on GitHub
- Go to: https://github.com/new
- Repository name: `celebration-of-service-summit` (or your preferred name)
- Choose Public or Private
- **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
- Click "Create repository"

### 2. After Creating the Repository

Copy your repository URL (it will look like):
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/celebration-of-service-summit.git
```

### 3. Push Your Code

Once you share your repository URL, I'll add the remote and push for you. Or you can run these commands:

```bash
# Add the remote (replace with your actual URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/celebration-of-service-summit.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Alternative: Using GitHub Desktop

1. Open GitHub Desktop
2. Click "File" > "Add Local Repository"
3. Select this folder
4. Click "Publish repository" and follow the prompts

Your code is already committed locally and ready to push!
